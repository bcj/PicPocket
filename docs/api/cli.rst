Command-Line Interface
======================

Once PicPocket is installed, it wil be accessible from the command line using the `picpocket` command.

Use the `--help` flag on categories and commands to see how to use it.

On the command line, `mount` information is not stored between invocations.
If a command requires access to a file, it will accept a `--mount` flag that either takes the path or the name of the location and its path.

Most commands have several options for output formatting, including `--json` for JSON-formatted output
