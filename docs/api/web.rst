Web Interface
=============

The web interface needs to be started from the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

    picpocket web --port 8080

While the web interface is under active development, it is considered experimental.
The interface is separately versioned, so it *should* be safe to write a scraper against a specific (non-dev) version, but it is not recommended.
